title: How Netlify became irrelevant
---

Launching a product is a good thing... except when it is not, like it is the case with the new analytics product from Netlify. 

Their new product launch makes it easier to compare Netlify to their biggest competitor: CloudCannon. Netlify and CloudCannon both offer static website hosting on a CDN with analytics (through log analysis). Both will process your forms with optional captcha and both offer a CMS for your static website. The main difference is their pricing.

Netlify

- price: 9 dollar per month per website
- the fee is for the analytics only
- 100 forms per month per site (+19 dollar per month if you need more)

CloudCannon

- price: 25 dollar per month for unlimited websites
- analytics are included
- unlimited forms

Sure... if you want a single website with limited form submissions you should choose Netlify, but as soon as you want more the choice is clear. Comparing these two options suddenly became very easy. 

CloudCannon has a more mature product than Netlify. Until today we could have thought that the lack of analytics in Netlify was due to its immaturaty. We could have hoped that Netlify would add this missing feature sooner or later. Now we know they want you to pay premium for it. Not very cool and not a smart move from Netlify.
