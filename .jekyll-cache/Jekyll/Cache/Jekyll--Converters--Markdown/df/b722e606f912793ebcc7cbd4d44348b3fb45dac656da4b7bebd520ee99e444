I"ˆ<p>Back in the days, your website would be a rectangle, filled with one big interactive Flash canvas. The nice thing about it was that it would always fit your screen. Nowadays I sometimes get the request to build something like that again.</p>

<p>Flash, obviously, is a no-go, so I built a demo to show how to do that in HTML and CSS. I have NOT used â€˜remsâ€™, â€˜percentagesâ€™, or â€˜viewport-widthâ€™ in the CSS. Everything is defined in pixels and then â€˜transform(scale)â€™ is applied to the HTML. Check it out!</p>
