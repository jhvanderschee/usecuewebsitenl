title: Need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for speed]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed))' by EA. Although I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a squadron of police cars, this article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically the speed at which websites load.

## Impatient visitors

Websites should aim to load in 3 seconds or less. Research on e-commerce websites shows that 40 percent of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage and mobile traffic causes an increase in [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms. So basically you only have 2.8 seconds to serve your website. This is plenty, you would think. However, the avarage loading time of websites is about 3.7 seconds, which means OVER 50% is failing to achieve this goal. Slow websites lose a significant amount of visitors.

## A better ranking

But a slow website has another problem: It might not even show up in Google. Google penalizes slow websites. They do this since 2010. In 2013 they announced they were going to do this for mobile websites too. Since late 2017 they actually do this. Everybody wants to rank high in the most popular search engine of the world.
