title: Need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed)' by EA. I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a squadron of police cars. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically **the speed at which your website loads**. Equally exciting, but far more important, as speed is a big success factor. Allow me to explain why.

## Impatient visitors

Research on e-commerce websites shows that 40 percent of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage. Mobile traffic causes has an increased [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms. So **your website should load within 2.8 seconds**, otherwise you will lose a significant amount of traffic. The avarage loading time of websites is about 3.7 seconds. This means that OVER 50% of the websites is failing to render within three seconds. These slow websites lose a lot of visitors while loading.

## A better ranking

A slow website has another problem: It might not reach that first page or position in Google. Google penalizes slow websites. They do this since 2010. In 2013 they announced they were going to do this for mobile websites too. Since late 2017 speed is an actual ranking factor in mobile search. This makes improving your websites speed an important search engine optimization. Google favors fast websites over slow ones.

## More conversion

Every second costs you 7% conversion.

## Better UX

Quicker navigation equals better UX.

## Speed is needed for success

Speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to its speed.

## A real life example

Let us look at at a responsive retina-ready onepager, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:

It can be only 1 megabyte large and load in **0.6 seconds**. You just need the right [optimizations](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/pink-fjord.cloudvent.net/trXljyaE). If this relatively complex single page website can meet the requirements, EVERY page can.

## Doing it yourself

You can get some valuable advice from independent speed anlysis tools like ([Google Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and ([Yslow](http://yslow.org/)). They tell you exactly how to make your web page faster.
