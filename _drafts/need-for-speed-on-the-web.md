title: Need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular [racing game title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed) 'Need for speed' by EA. This is about the speed at which websites load. Because... who does not like to go fast?

We have heard it all before... Websites should aim to load in 3 seconds or less [sources: [Hubspot](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade), [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2009-press/akamai-reveals-2-seconds-as-the-new-threshold-of-acceptability-for-ecommerce-web-page-response-times.jsp) and Neilson]. If not, people will leave your website. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage and mobile traffic adds a [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) increase of about 200ms [source: [Wikipedia](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/live/7/post/83/measuring_wikipedia_page_load_times/)]. So basically we only have 2.8 seconds to fully load your website. This is plenty, you would think. However, the avarage loading time of websites is about 3.7 seconds [source: [Hubspot](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade)], which means OVER 50% is failing to achieve this goal.

Do you know that your next website is making the cut? You could order a website from Usecue BV to make sure you are not going to be needing a speed or SEO optimizer.

To prove this, we will provide an independent speed anlysis by Google ([Google Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and Yahoo ([Yslow](http://yslow.org/)) along with every website we deliver. Additionally we provide a SEO analysis by [Varvy](https://varvy.com/) and [SEO centro](http://seocentro.com), to show you your website is perfectly optimized for the Search Engine.
