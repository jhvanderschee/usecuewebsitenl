title: Need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for speed]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed))' by EA. I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a squadron of police cars. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically the speed at which websites load. Equally exciting, but far more important, as speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Allow me to explain why.

## Impatient visitors

Research on e-commerce websites shows that 40 percent of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage. Mobile traffic causes has an increased [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms. So basically you only have 2.8 seconds to serve your website. The avarage loading time of websites is about 3.7 seconds, which means OVER 50% is failing to render within three seconds. These slow websites lose a significant amount of visitors.

## A better ranking

A slow website has another problem: It might not even show up in Google. Google penalizes slow websites. They do this since 2010. In 2013 they announced they were going to do this for mobile websites too. Since late 2017 speed is an actual ranking factor in mobile search. This makes improving your websites speed an important search engine optimization. Google favors fast websites over slow ones.

## More conversion

## Better UX

## Speed equals success

Speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to 

## A real life example

Let us look at a retina-ready onepager, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:

It can be only 1 megabyte large and load in **0.6 seconds**. You just need the right [optimizations](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/pink-fjord.cloudvent.net/trXljyaE). If this relatively complex single page website can meet the requirements, EVERY page can.

## Doing it yourself

You can get some valuable advice from independent speed anlysis tools like ([Google Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)) and ([Yslow](http://yslow.org/)). They tell you exactly how to make your web page faster.
