title: Need for speed on the web
---

This is not a post about a web-version of the popular racing game title '[Need for Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed)' by EA. I love that game and I have wasted too many hours racing through dark cities and endless highways, followed by a squadron of police cars. This article is about something else: The speed of the internet and specifically **the speed at which your website loads**. 

Equally exciting, but far more important, as website speed is a big success factor, [speed matters](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/). More than 20 years after Neilson Norman Group posted an [article with the same title](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/), this is still relevant. Allow me to explain why.

## Impatient visitors

Research on e-commerce websites shows that 40 percent of consumers will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site. We also know mobile traffic is growing in percentage. Mobile traffic [causes](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/live/7/post/83/measuring_wikipedia_page_load_times/) has an increased [latency](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8553/network-latency) of about 200ms, making your website even slower. The avarage loading time of websites is currently [about 3.7 seconds](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/does-your-website-make-the-grade). This means that OVER 50% of the websites is failing to render within three seconds and this number is expected to only increase with the rise of mobile traffic. These slow websites lose a lot of visitors while loading, especially on mobile phones (Google can [calculate](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/nl-nl) how many).

## A better ranking

A slow website has another problem: It might not reach that first page or position in Google. Google [penalizes](https://yoast.com/site-speed-tools-suggestions/) slow websites. They do this [since 2010](https://searchengineland.com/google-says-page-speed-ranking-factor-use-mobile-page-speed-mobile-sites-upcoming-months-250874). In 2013 they announced they were going to do this for mobile websites too. From [July 2018](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) speed will actually be a ranking factor in mobile search. This makes improving your websites speed an important search engine optimization. Google will favor fast websites over slow ones on all platforms.

## More conversion

Examples [show](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/page-load-time-conversion-rates) that speedy websites have more conversion than slow websites. Visitors will be [significantly more likely](https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/wpo/2014/04/web-page-speed-affect-conversions-infographic/) to fill out an order form, enter contact details or subscribe to an email newsletter on a fast loading website. Making your website faster can easily result in a [20% conversion increase](http://www.webperformancetoday.com/2010/07/01/the-best-graphs-of-velocity/). 

## Better UX

Quicker navigation equals better UX.

## Speed matters

Speed is a big factor in the success of your website. Your website will rank better, have more visitors, more conversion and a better experience. The value of your website is directly related to its speed. Speed really [matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch/OlbJKOWEPEM).

## A real life example

Let us look at at a responsive retina-ready onepager, with custom fonts, a lot of imagery and javascript, that looks like this:

![](/uploads/speedexample.jpg)

It can be only 1 megabyte large and load in [0.6 seconds](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/pink-fjord.cloudvent.net/trXljyaE), as reported by [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). If this relatively complex single page website can meet the requirements, EVERY page can.

## Doing it yourself

You can get some valuable advice from independent speed anlysis tools like [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) and Google's [mobile speed tester for 3G](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com/intl/gb-int). They will give you the numbers and tell you exactly how to make your web page faster.
